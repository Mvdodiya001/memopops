# Saqlain activity log

Task-level notes for Saqlain and agents working on his behalf. Times include timezone. Do not record secrets or hidden reasoning.

## S-20261017-01

- Updated: 2026-10-17T15:08:26+05:30
- Human / agent: Saqlain / Codex
- Status: completed
- Branch / scope: main; initial documentation bootstrap only. User explicitly requested commit and push to GitHub. Future tasks default to personal task branches and PRs.
- Objective: establish practical two-person agent rules, a concise master log, and separate detailed personal logs grounded in project context and collaboration research.
- Context read: supplied compiled DOCX; latest concept is proof-carrying shared memory, not the earlier GraphFence/ReleaseGuard suggestions. Historical document instructions were treated as context. Original DOCX was not uploaded.
- Actions: inspected clean repository (initial commit e7a134d), read document XML, researched official agent/Git guidance, Reddit discussion, X posts via indexed mirrors, and official event requirements. Direct X page retrieval failed and is disclosed in research notes.
- Files: AGENTS.md, README.md, docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, docs/COLLABORATION.md, docs/RESEARCH.md, logs/MASTER.md, logs/saqlain.md, logs/mahavir.md, .github/pull_request_template.md, .gitignore, .gitattributes.
- Decisions: isolate concurrent writers; use task branches and explicit claims; keep personal logs separate; preserve both master entries on conflicts; require actual evidence for checks and proof claims. No permanent module assignments, CI, app stack, or repository protections invented.
- Validation: git diff --check passed; all local Markdown link targets across 11 documentation/configuration files resolved; files normalized to UTF-8/LF. git fetch origin succeeded; git rev-list --left-right --count main...origin/main returned 0/0 before commit. Reviewed document content and staged scope. No executable code changed; application tests are not applicable.
- Outcome / blockers: documentation prepared and checked. No app or test runner exists. Branch protection/CI are recommendations, not configured controls.
- Handoff: agree minimal API/schema, implementation stack and concurrency protocol, then assign first vertical slice between Saqlain and Mahavir. This task starts no implementation or extra agents.
- Publication: local commit created on main; git push origin main failed with HTTP 403: permission denied to authenticated account SaqlainSQX. Remote main remains e7a134d. Proxy/network access works. No credentials changed or force push attempted. User must ensure this account has accepted repository write access or authenticate the intended contributor account; retry git push origin main afterward. This failure note is included by amending the same unpublished bootstrap commit.

### Publication correction 2026-10-17T15:12:38+05:30

User requested retry after access changed. git push origin main succeeded (e7a134d to cf23569). git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main matched local HEAD cf23569dd71ba1efdfdf190a68e7f9bc1056183c; git status showed main synchronized with origin/main and a clean working tree. The earlier 403 is historical and no longer blocks this task. This follow-up records the verified publication outcome.

- Updated: 2026-10-17T15:35:43+05:30
- Human / agent: Saqlain / Codex
- Status: ready-for-review
- Branch / scope: codex/saqlain/implementation-plan; eight plan documents, agent rules/navigation/context, and Saqlain/master logs. No application code implemented.
- Objective: detailed parallel implementation plan with exact contracts, proof/concurrency semantics, performance bounds, interface specification, tests, delivery gates and handoffs.
- Research: official organizer rules, current FalkorDB atomicity/indexing/persistence/limitations, Redis transaction semantics, Z3 documentation, CMU/UW logic material, Apple HIG official JSON, WCAG and deployment guidance. Sources and execution-dependent uncertainties are recorded in docs/plan/RESEARCH.md.
- Decisions: bounded Boolean AST and full-snapshot solving; atomic revision-guarded publication; separate mathematical result/proof/freshness; independent checker with trusted expected context; Saqlain backend/graph/solver and Mahavir interface/checker/clients/evaluation; neutral accessible visual design.
- Validation: all five CNF operator templates passed exhaustive evaluation over 36 assignments; six canonical demo outcomes passed exhaustive four-atom checks; six text/background contrast ratios exceed 4.5:1. Eight plan documents, eight internal links and five JSON examples passed draft checks. Reviewed trust boundary, unknown cache invalidation, failed-tests rule, idempotency and realistic scope cuts. Final repository link/reference/whitespace checks are performed before commit.
- Files: docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md; docs/plan/{ARCHITECTURE,CONTRACTS,PARALLEL_EXECUTION,INTERFACE,VERIFICATION,RESEARCH,VALIDATION}.md; AGENTS.md; README.md; docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md; logs/MASTER.md; logs/saqlain.md.
- Outcome: planning complete and ready for teammate review. No database/runtime/browser/benchmark results are claimed. Exact dependency compatibility and commit-query behavior remain explicit G0 tasks.
- Handoff: both humans review/freeze G0 contracts; Saqlain starts S0/S1/S2 and Mahavir starts M0/M1/M2 in separate branches/checkouts. Copyable agent prompts are in the runbook. No extra agent launched and no message sent to another chat.
- Publication: pushed planning commit f5585a4 and verified remote HEAD matched. Opened [PR #1](https://github.com/Mvdodiya001/memopops/pull/1) for review. A follow-up removes session-specific identity from shared AGENTS.md so Mahavir's agent cannot inherit Saqlain identity from repository text. User's standing instruction authorizes this publication; main remains pending review.
